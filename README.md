## Introduction

## What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** that allows you to track changes in your code or documents over time. It enables multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. With Git, you can:

- **Save snapshots** of your work
- **Collaborate** with peers
- **Undo mistakes** easily

Before you can use Git, you need to install it on your computer. Download Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Configure Git

After installing Git, set up your name and email. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
